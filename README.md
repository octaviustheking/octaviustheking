## Heya!
I'm octaviustheking, or ImmatureGoat, as I use more commonly. 

I mostly use Python, HTML, CSS, and JS, and I suck at all 4!

My website is here: https://octaviustheking.github.io/immaturegoat/

I'm currently working on developing my personal website and making it work. 

I'm part of Studio BDT, along with SamuelHZhuang and NeoRazer504

I'm open to any communication! You can find my contact info in my website.
