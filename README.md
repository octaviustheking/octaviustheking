## Heya!
I'm octaviustheking, or ImmatureGoat, as I use more commonly. 

I mostly use Python, HTML, CSS, and JS, and I suck at all 4!

You can find my website <a href="https://octaviustheking.github.io/immaturegoat/">here!</a> 

I'm currently working on developing my personal website and making it work. 

I'm part of Studio BDT, along with <a href="https://github.com/SamuelHZhuang">SamuelHZhuang</a> and <a href="https://github.com/NeoRazer504">NeoRazer504</a>

I'm open to any communication! You can find my contact info in my website.
